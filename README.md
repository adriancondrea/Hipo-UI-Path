# Hipo-UI-Path

Create an excel sheet with data about the title, profile, city, level of the job, and type of the job (full/part-time). These have to match the existing options in Hipo.ro. The User has to log on the site using Windows credentials and search for job offers using the data in excel. These have to be extracted in a seperate file and then the user has to apply to all of them one by one.

Extra requirement: create CV after login (before applying to jobs). Use whatever data you like, from an excel file. Not all fields must be present.

Tasks:
[ ]Read from excel sheet (title, profile, city, level of the job) and save to variables
- log in using windows credentials
- search for job (using data extracted from excel -> advanced search)
- extract job data in a separate file
- apply to each job (save in favourite list)
- read CV data from excel (use same activity as 1.) and save to variables
- create CV
- Assemble everything together and hope it works

Take into consideration after finishing implementation tasks:
- Exceptions: (excel sheet from 1. contains invalid data; invalid windows credentials; CV data invalid)
